I'm an Angular Developer Advocate & GDE. My two degrees (Web Design & Development and Psychology) feed my speaking career. I started in tech a short 4 years ago and have spoken at over 40 conferences Internationally, specializing in motivational soft talks. I'm a weekly panelist on Adventures in Angular and Angular Air, which have a combined following of over 16,000 listeners. I enjoy gaming, scuba diving, and have a furry weiner dog named Beef. My DM is always open, come talk sometime.
